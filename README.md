# Ursa Major Ask

The Ursa Major Ask is a powerful tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to simulate a chat with a fictional 'Director of Research Computing' character who is an expert in Google's Ursa Major platform. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

## Prerequisites

The primary dependencies for this project are:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API Python client

Use the following command to install the OpenAI client:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that you have the OpenAI API key. Set this key in your environment variables or in the `config.py` file. 

## How it Works

The script accepts a transcript as a command line argument. The transcript is fed to the `ursa_major_expert` function which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a response. The generated response is treated as a script. The script is then saved to a file with the correct file extension and executed.

## Usage

You can run the script from the command line with the following command:

```
python3 Ursa_Major_Ask "your text here"
```

Replace "your text here" with your desired questions.

The `ursa_major_expert` function initiates a conversation with GPT-3.5-turbo, where it plays the role of a 'Director of Research Computing'. The character is described as an expert in Ursa Major, a Google Cloud Platform offering.

The AI returns a chat completion based on the input transcript, which is then saved to a file and executed.

## Powerful File Input and Data Analysis

`Ursa_Major_Ask` isn't just designed to accept file input â€“ it's built to harness the full potential of OpenAI's GPT-3 model, enabling sophisticated analysis and interpretation of the data you feed into it. This elevates `Ursa_Major_Ask` from a mere command-line tool to a versatile solution for a wide range of data processing tasks.

Whether you are dealing with scripts, structured text files, or raw data, `Ursa_Major_Ask` can process it, and utilize the language understanding capabilities of GPT-3 to provide meaningful insights.

The power of this approach lies in its versatility. You are not limited to scripts or programming languages; you can feed in any type of text file and let the model analyze it based on the question you ask.

### Examples

1. **Analyzing a CSV data file**: If you have a CSV file, `sales_data.csv`, containing sales data for a period, you could ask:

    ```
    Ursa_Major_Ask "analyze the sales trend $(cat sales_data.csv)"
    ```
    `Ursa_Major_Ask` will provide you with an interpretation of the sales trend based on the data in the file.

2. **Understanding Log Files**: You have a log file, `server.log`, and you want to know about any critical errors. You can ask:

    ```
    Ursa_Major_Ask "find critical errors $(cat server.log)"
    ```
    The command-line tool will provide a summary of the critical errors found in the log file.

3. **Interpreting Complex XML or JSON data**: You can even feed complex XML or JSON files. For instance, with a complex JSON data file `user_data.json`, you might want to understand the user behavior it signifies:

    ```
    Ursa_Major_Ask "interpret user behavior $(cat user_data.json)"
    ```
    `Ursa_Major_Ask` will then provide an interpretation of the user behavior based on the data.

Remember, `Ursa_Major_Ask` is as powerful and versatile as the questions you ask and the data you feed. It leverages the robustness of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to analyze, understand, and provide insights on a wide array of data.

Please note that the file paths in these examples are relative. If your files are in different directories, be sure to include the correct paths. Also, ensure the data or text you're feeding into `Ursa_Major_Ask` does not contain sensitive or personal information, as it will be processed by an external AI model.
